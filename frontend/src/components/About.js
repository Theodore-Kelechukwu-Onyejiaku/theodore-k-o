                            As a JavaScript Developer, Theodore uses Technologies such as ReactJs, NextJs, NodeJs, and ExpressJs, and React Native, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Postgres.
                            He also tries to contribute to the community to share his knowledge through Technical Writing.
                            Education is particularly where his interest lies. And this is why he writes. And he hopes to build a solution that will be disruptive someday.
                            Currently, he is writing an article on building an Online Dictionary with React Native using Merriam-Webster Dictionary API and Unsplash API. At the time of writing this, he works as a Frontend Engineer, where he uses technologies such as ReactJs, NextJs, and Redux to build and transform intuitive and high-performant front-end applications. Presently, he is currently writing for Geek Culture on Medium. And very soon, he will have writings on other publication agencies such as logRocket and the likes. And lastly, Theodore is open to Front-end Developer Roles and Technical Writing Roles.
